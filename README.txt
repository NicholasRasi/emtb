This project is a simple data field for Garmin watches, built using Garmin Connect IQ (CIQ).

It allows your watch to connect to a a Shimano STEPS e-bike using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 
and display useful information (like battery percentage, assist mode, gear number).

The app is released on the Garmin app store here: https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/461743f9-b350-486f-bd87-613c7b0bab90
